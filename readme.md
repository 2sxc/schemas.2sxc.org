# schemas.2sxc.org â€“ 2sxc Schemas

This is just a lightweight repo which will contain public schemas for use in the 2sxc application.

The site containing the schemas is in the folder `/docs` because that's required by Github ATM.

## Naming Convention WIP

probably always

* `/topic|schema/`
  * `v13` for the version the schema was released in
    * `index.json` for the initial file
    * `tests/...` contains test json files
  * `v13b` for releases / changes which would be relevant
